# Would You Rather - Serverless App

## Functionality of the application

This application allows users to play the would you rather game by answering and creating questions. The goal of this project was to build and deploy a serverless application on AWS. To accomplish this task, I built the API using TypeScript and the frontend using the React framework.

## How to run the application

### Prerequisites

* AWS account
* npm
* Auth0

#### AWS Serverless

1. Install serverless `npm install -g serverless`

2. On your AWS account, set up a new user in IAM named "serverless" with Programmatic access and with AdministratorAccess policy attached and save the access key and secret key.

3. Configure serverless to use the AWS credentials you just set up:
`sls config credentials --provider aws --key YOUR_ACCESS_KEY --secret YOUR_SECRET_KEY --profile serverless`

#### Authentification

1. On your Auth0 account, create a new application with React framework. 

2. On the Settings -> Application URIs -> Allowed Callback URLs insert: `http://localhost:3000/callback`, and Allowed Web Origins: `http://localhost:3000/`

### Backend

To deploy this application and generate your apiId, use the following commands: `sls deploy -v`.

### Frontend

To have the application running on your local machine, edit the `client/src/config.ts` file to set correct parameters. After running sucessfully `sls deploy -v`, the endpoints generated by the sls command will be displayed with this configuration `https://${apiId}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`.  Replace apiId with the value 

```
const apiId = 'YOUR_API_ID'
```

Then replace, the domain and clientId with the values found on your Auth0 account:

```
export const authConfig = {
  domain: 'YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN',
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
  callbackUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/callback'
}
```

Then run the following commands:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

## Screens

### Dashboard (Home Screen)

A list of all polls posted is displayed on the home screen. The user can toggle a button to see either the polls that has been answered or unanswered by himself.

### Poll Details

By clicking on vote on one specific poll from the home page, the user is able to vote provided that he has not done so before. There is 2 options for each poll.
Upon voting in a poll, information about how many people voted for one particular option is displayed along with the user's response.

### Submit new polling question

The user can submit a new question by entering 2 options. Once created, the new question will be added  to the unanswered questions of the dashboard.

## About the DB structure

### Database tables

The backend is using DynamoDB databases provisioned on the serverless file by AWS. 

#### QUESTION items

The application store QUESTION items, and each QUESTION item contains the following fields:

* `questionId` (string) - a unique id for an item
* `userId` (string) - the user id that created this QUESTION item
* `timestamp` (string) - date and time when an item was created
* `optionOneText` (string) - name of 1st option (e.g. "Win the lottery")
* `optionTwoText` (string) - name of 2nd option (e.g. "Have many friends")
* `optionOneVote` (array) - List of userId(s) who voted for the 1st option
* `optionTwoVote` (array) - List of userId(s) who voted for the 2nd option
* `attachmentUrl` (string) (optional) - a URL pointing to an image attached to a QUESTION item

#### USER information

The application store User information, and each USER item contains the following fields:

* `userId` (string) - a unique id for a user
* `answers` (object) - with the questionId as attribute and the option selected (optionOne or optionTwo) for each answered question. This allows to filter questions for a specific user by "answering status"

## API endpoints

### Authentification

* `Auth` - this function implement a custom authorizer for API Gateway that has been added to all other functions.

### Question API

* `GetQuestions` - return all QUESTIONs for a current user . A user id can be extracted from a JWT token that is sent by the frontend. Receive 2 optional parameters: 
- nextKey: Next key to continue scan operation if necessary
- limit: Maximum number of elements to return

`GET https://{{apiId}}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/questions?limit=2`

It returns data that looks like this:

```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "optionTwoText": "Go West",
            "optionOneText": "Go East",
            "optionTwoVote": [
                "4551045727"

            "optionOneVote": [
                "4551045727",
                "1234567891"
            ],
            "timestamp": "2020-06-06T01:47:03.364Z"
        }
    ]
}
```
* `GetQuestion` - return a single QUESTION item by userId and by questionId. 

`GET https://{{apiId}}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/users/{userId}/questions/{questionId}`

It returns data that looks like this:

```json
{
    "item": {
        "optionTwoText": "Two things",
        "optionOneText": "One thing",
        "optionTwoVote": [
            "4551045727",
            "5588959907"
        ],
        "questionId": "91ea0481-e7c3-4b39-83a6-edaf3f2ff46e",
        "attachmentUrl": "https://serverless-wyr-files-dev.s3.amazonaws.com/91ea0481-e7c3-4b39-83a6-edaf3f2ff46e",
        "userId": "4551045727",
        "optionOneVote": [
            "4551045123",
        ],
        "timestamp": "2020-06-06T01:47:03.364Z"
    }
}
```


* `CreateQuestion` - create a new QUESTION for a current user. A shape of data send by a client application to this function can be found in the `requests/CreateQuestionRequest.ts` file

`POST https://{{apiId}}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/questions`

```
body: {
	"optionOneText": "Go East",
	"optionTwoText": "Go West"
}
```

It returns a new QUESTION item that looks like this:

```json
{
    "item": {
        "optionTwoText": "Go West",
        "optionOneText": "Go East",
        "questionId": "286c3233-a2fa-496a-9bc9-9d8cab3ed5f5",
        "userId": "4551045727",
        "timestamp": "2020-06-09T21:58:00.982Z"
    }
}
```

* `SubmitVote` - update a QUESTION item with the vote submitted by a current user. It uses the userId which is here the creator of the question (not the current user) and the questionId in the path to identify a question.

`PATCH https://{{apiId}}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/users/{userId}/questions/{questionId}`

It receives an object that contains that the option selected:

```json
{
  "optionSelected": "OptionOne",
}
```

The id of the current user (responder of the poll) is extracted from a JWT token passed by the client.

This function will update the QUESTION item as well as the USER item:
- It will append the userId (responder id) to the optionSelected parameter (optionOneVote/optionTwoVote) of the QUESTION item: 
```
{
    ...
    "optionOneVote": [..., "4551045123"]
}
```
- It will add a new element to the answers parameter of the USER item with the questionId as key and optionSelected as value. 
```
{
    ...
    "answers": {
        ..., 
        "286c3233-a2fa-496a-9bc9-9d8cab3ed5f5": "optionOne"
    }
}
```


It returns an empty body.

* `DeleteQuestion` - delete a QUESTION item created by a current user. Expects an id of a QUESTION item to remove. 

`DELETE https://{{apiId}}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/questions/{questionId}`

It returns an empty body.

* `GenerateUploadUrl` - it is used to add a picture to a QUESTION item.

`POST https://{{apiId}}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/questions/{questionId}/attachment`

It returns a JSON object that looks like this:

```json
{
  "uploadUrl": "https://{{s3-bucket-name.s3}}.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/{{image-name}}.png"
}
```

This pre-signed URL is then used to upload an attachment file to a s3 bucket for a QUESTION item. It then updates the QUESTION item by adding an attachmentUrl key with the s3 location of the item as value `{attachmentUrl: "https://${bucketName}.s3.amazonaws.com/${questionId}"}`


### User API

* `createUser` - add a new user to the database:

`POST https://{{apiId}}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/users`

```json
{
    "user": [
        {
            "answers": {},
            "userId": "5588959907"
        }
    ]
}
```

* `getResponsesByUser` - returns user information for a current user using the JWT token that is sent by the frontend.

`GET https://{{apiId}}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/users`

```json
{
    "user": [
        {
            "answers": {
                "286c3233-a2fa-496a-9bc9-9d8cab3ed5f5": "optionOne",
                "286c3233-a2fa-496a-9bc9-9d8cab3ed5f5": "optionTwo"
                },
            "userId": "5588959907"
        }
    ]
}
```



All functions are already connected to appropriate events from API Gateway.

An id of a user can be extracted from a JWT token passed by a client.

The `serverless.yml` file includes all of these functions as well as a DynamoDB table and a S3 bucket in the `resources`.
